# tf-nn-maze-solver
MSc project code, using TensorFlow to implement a neural network that can solve a small 2D maze with reinforcement learning

The "network....py" files are mostly the same. Run the file corresponding to the desired maze structure, or modify the code to suit another structure.

maze.py can be run on its own as an interactive maze.
